Today we’ll focus on getting oriented to the course and the tools we’ll be using throughout the semester. Readings are designed to help understand some of the ‘rules’ of R syntax and develop an understanding for manipulating different types of data in R.

## Resources

-   <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> The introductory vignette for the [`sf` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) has a lot of useful info on `sf` objects and conventions.

-   <i class="fas fa-book"></i> The [`raster` package vignette](/static/docs/RasterPackage.pdf) has a number of helpful examples for different workflows with raster objects in `R`.

-   <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> The [`terra` package vignette](https://rspatial.org/terra/pkg/1-introduction.html#) describes the new raster functions available in `terra`, their relationship to those in the `raster` package, and the changes in syntax between the two.
